Perfect 👍 I’ll craft a professional README.md for your project using the exact commands you gave me, plus adding advantages, why we built this, and a future scope (Thymeleaf frontend) section.

Here’s the full README.md you can drop into your repo ⬇️

# 🚀 Dev AI Assist – Microservices Suite

Dev AI Assist is a **Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.x** based microservices suite that provides AI-powered developer tools.  
It currently consists of **independent backend services & REST endpoints**, each focused on a specific task like code optimization, bug finding, design principle checks, auto JavaDocs generation, and JUnit test generation.

In the future, we can extend this platform with a **Thymeleaf-based frontend** for an integrated UI.

---

## ✨ Why We Built This

- Developers often spend hours on repetitive tasks like writing test cases, checking design principles, or documenting code.
- Our application **automates these tasks with AI** to save time and enforce best practices.
- Provides a **modular architecture** – each feature runs as an independent microservice, making it easy to extend and scale.

---

## ⚡ Advantages

- ✅ **Independent Microservices** → Each module can be started, tested, and deployed separately.
- ✅ **Eureka + API Gateway** → Centralized service discovery & routing.
- ✅ **AI-Powered** → Uses Ollama / LLMs for code analysis, bug finding, and optimizations.
- ✅ **Swagger UI for every service** → Easy testing of APIs.
- ✅ **Future-Ready** → Frontend (Thymeleaf or React) can consume the same APIs.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- **Java 21**
- **Gradle 8.x**
- **Docker** (optional, for DB/Kafka in future)
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code

Would you like me to also **add an architecture diagram (in PlantUML or ASCII)** to show how all microservices connect via **Eureka + API Gateway**? That will make your README look super professional 👌
